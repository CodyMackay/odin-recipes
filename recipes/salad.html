<p>Last weekend we served this salad at a dinner party. <strong>Wow! What’s in this salad?</strong> was murmured around the table. That’s when you know a recipe is a keeper!<br>
looks unassuming, but it’s one of our favorites to date. What carries this chopped salad is our <a href="https://www.acouplecooks.com/italian-dressing-recipe/">homemade Italian dressing recipe.</a> 
The flavor is zesty and bright, full of garlic, white wine vinegar, and balanced with a touch of maple syrup. Dried basil, thyme, and oregano bring in an earthy flair. (See our dressing tips below.)</p>

<p>Other than the dressing, this chopped salad is just a matter of, well, chopping up all the ingredients! Here we’ve chosen ingredients that vibe on an Italian chopped salad. You can feel free to customize the veggies in this chopped salad to your liking…but we found this combination to be just about perfect:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Crunchy veggies:</strong> shallot, cucumber, and cherry tomatoes</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Jarred pepperoncini:</strong> add a tang and a little heat</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Green olives:</strong> add just the right salty hit.</li>
</ul>
