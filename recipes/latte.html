<p>This latte is for all fellow coffee drinkers. I love cafe lattes but buying them can be pricey. So here's a recipe so you can make your own.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
        Heat milk in a saucepan set over medium-low heat. Whisk briskly with a wire whisk to create foam.</li><br>
        
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong><br>
        Brew espresso and pour into four cups. Pour in milk, holding back the foam with a spoon. Spoon foam over the top.</li>
